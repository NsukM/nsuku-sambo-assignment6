# Assignment 6: Agile User Stories, Backlog, and Sprint Planning

## *Objective*
Apply Agile methodology by converting system requirements into *user stories, prioritizing them into a **product backlog, and planning an **initial sprint* to deliver a *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*.

## *1. User Story Creation (30 Marks)*

### *User Stories Table*
| *Story ID* | *User Story* | *Acceptance Criteria* | *Priority* |
|-------------|---------------|------------------------|--------------|
| *US-001* | As a user, I want to track my *steps, heart rate, and calories burned in real-time* so that I can monitor my fitness activity. | Data updates every *2 seconds* without delay. | High |
| *US-002* | As a user, I want to receive *personalized fitness recommendations* so that I can optimize my workouts. | Recommendations update *weekly* based on activity. | High |
| *US-003* | As a user, I want to sync my *fitness tracker* with the app so that my data is updated automatically. | Device successfully syncs within *5 seconds*. | High |
| *US-004* | As a user, I want my fitness data stored *securely in the cloud* so that I can access it from anywhere. | Data is *encrypted* and retrievable across devices. | High |

## *2. Product Backlog Creation (30 Marks)*

### *Prioritized Backlog Using MoSCoW Method*
| *Story ID* | *User Story* | *Priority (MoSCoW)* | *Effort Estimate (Story Points)* | *Dependencies* |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|---------------|
| *US-001* | Real-time tracking of fitness metrics. | Must-have | 5 | None |
| *US-002* | Personalized fitness recommendations. | Must-have | 3 | US-001 |
| *US-003* | Sync with wearable devices. | Must-have | 5 | US-001 |
| *US-004* | Secure cloud storage for fitness data. | Must-have | 3 | None |
